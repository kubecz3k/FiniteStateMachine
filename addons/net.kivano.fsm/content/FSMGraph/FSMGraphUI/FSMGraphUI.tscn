# * To create new state check  \"Create New:\" subsection in FSM inspector

# * Dont be afraid to check FSM script to check available methods 
#
# * Exported Variables of FSM which are intended to be used by users:
#
#     NodePath path2LogicRoot: states usually perform logic based on variables in
#         some external node, like 'Enemy'. This variable usually points to this node. 
#         It dont have any other purpose other than to be available for child states.
#
#     bool onlyActiveStateOnTheScene: if this is true, then only active state is present
#         on scene tree. It might be handy if states have visual representation
#
#     bool initManually: #you can set this to true to set export vars in runtime from code,
#         before you will be able to use this FSM you will need to run init() function. 
#         Run init() only after setting exported variables.
#
#     string Initial state: you can choose from this list with which state FSM should start.
#
#     int updateMode: if set to manual, then it's up to you to update this FSM. In this case 
#         you need to call FSM.update(inDeltaTime) to update this fsm (usually once per frame)
#         
#
########## 
# * Exported variables that are editor helpers:
#
#      Subdirectory for states: you can set name of directory which will be automatically 
#          created to hold all states for this FSM
#
#      Create state with name: when you enter and accept name for a state it will be 
#          immediatelly created and added to scene tree as a child of current FSM
#          This state will have an unique script in which you can implement state logic.
#
#
###########
# * Functions that are intended to be used by users:
#
#     getStateID(): return name of current state
#
#     getState(): return node with current state  
#
#     changeStateTo(inNewStateID): can be used to change state. 
#        Usually dont need to be used if you are using graph to link your states
#      
#     stateTime(): returns how long current state is active
#
#     update(inDeltaTime): update FSM to update current state. Should be
#        used in every game tick, but should use it only if you are using 
#        updateMode=\"Manual\".
#
#    init(): use only if initManually = true. You will be able to pass additional arguments
#        to your states and transitions

################
# * Members that are intended to be used by users:
#    STATE: you can use this dictionary to access state id. Using is it recommended because it's less error prone than 
#        entering states ids by hand. ex. fsm.changeStateTo(fsm.STATE.START) <- when one of your states is named 'START'
